This extension adds a special page that shows a message is parsed with all the language names that are supported by an installation of MediaWiki. This is useful for seeing how well can all the different language names fit into sentences in a given language.

This current version is just a first development with hard-coded Russian. To do something useful it depends on the MediaWiki Gerrit commit https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/172501.
